        <p>I was born in North Kingstown, RI in 1990. I grew up in a nice quite neighborhood a minute walk from the ocean.
            My first career was a musicain which I loved dearly, unfortunately there is not much money
            in music so I had to find other sources of income. I then went to school for massage therapy
            at Bancroft, which is located in Worcester MA. That career allowed me to survive while still playing
            music at night. I eventually burned out from rubbing strangers bodies and did electrical
            work for 3 years. 
            <p>I learned quite a bit from doing electrical work buit at the end of the day it was very repeptive 
            and the people I was working with werent people I wanted to nsurround myself with.
            I went back to school for mechanical engineering and one day my body convinced me 
            to take a coding class. I was hooked! I find myself thinking about code atleast 5 hours 
            a day and I am always excited to get back on the compuiter to figure out the next step.
